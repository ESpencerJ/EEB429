# Probability Distribution Demonstration


Goals
1. Develop familiarity with one of a set of commonly used probability distributions
2. Establish basic skills with RShiny
3. Create a study guide to teach others about that distribution (and use their study guides to learn
about their distributions)


Overview
You will create an interactive RShiny app that introduces your assigned probability distribution to others.
In small groups in class, you will then present your distributions to each other. Your documents will serve
as a study guide to your distribution.
Organization & Timeline
1. You will be assigned a distribution from the following list:
a. (continuous): beta, exponential, gamma, lognormal, normal, uniform
b. (discrete): poisson, geometric, negative binomial, Bernoulli
2. You will then create an Rmarkdown study guide for your assigned distribution, including:
a. A brief history of the distribution
i. wikipedia can be your friend here
ii. citations unnecessary unless you make outlandish claims
b. A walkthrough of the notation, with an explanation of all parameters
c. A description of mean and variance, with intuition-(and character!)-building discussion
d. State the bounds of the distribution (if they exist), and state whether it is continuous or
discrete
e. Examples of data that are well described by the distribution (preferably biological, better
if it's an example from a field of biology that youâ€™re interested in)
3. Shiny demo (based off the posted example)
4. Your Rmarkdown distribution study guide is due Feb 26 by 11:29am
**** NOTE: you must hand in your study guide as a .Rmd file that knits locally ***
(i.e., does not depend on any files saved locally on your computer)
